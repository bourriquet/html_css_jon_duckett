		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

		<div class="col1">
			<h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
			<p>In 1817, Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get
			around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels, the front one
			steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was
			propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and
			the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>

			<p>The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made
			entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being
			practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway
			such as in a park or garden.</p>

			<h3>Further Innovations</h3>
			<p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when
			pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the
			velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since its
			wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an
			extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding
			academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
